## Installing Java
* Install the standard JDK from Oracle. http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html 
* <b>Java 8</b> required (as of Jan. 2017) on VM's where the server is to be deployed as KnetMinder code has been migrated to Java 1.8.

## Installing Eclipse

(at time of writing Eclipse-Kepler)

* Download “Eclipse IDE for Java Developers” (http://www.eclipse.org/downloads) 
* Unpack the zip file (creating D:\eclipse).

-vm 
PATH_TO_JDK\bin\javaw.exe 

* Save and Start D:\eclipse\eclipse.exe
* Set your workspace, e.g. D:\WorkspaceGit

## How to use automatically deploy a war file to a remote Tomcat server
* To the pom.xml file for each project you would like to deploy, a new plugin must be defined:
```
<plugins>
	...
	<plugin>
		<groupId>org.apache.tomcat.maven</groupId>
		<artifactId>tomcat6-maven-plugin</artifactId>
		<version>2.2</version>
		<configuration>
			<url>http://my_tomcat_server:8080/manager</url>
			<server>myserver</server>
			<path>/${project.build.finalName}</path>
		</configuration>
	</plugin>
	...
</plugins>
```
Where `<url>` contains the address to the tomcat management page of the server you wish to deploy to.
And `<path>` is the path on the tomcat server to which the war file is deployed.

* Next each tomcat server with a different username and password  needs an entry in the maven settings.xml file.
```
<settings>
	...
	<servers>
		<server>
			<id>myserver</id>
			<username>user...</username>
			<password>pass...</password>
		</server>
	</servers>
	...
</settings>
```
Make sure the value for `<id>` matches the value inside the `<server>` tags in the previous section.
Fill in the username and password fields with those used to login to the tomcat management pages.

* Finally to deploy from eclipse, create a new run configuration with the base directory set to the project you wish to deploy, and for the goals use `tomcat6:redeploy`. This should now compile the project if it needs to and then deploy the generated war file to the specified server.
