Customizing both server and client
------------------------------------------

Now, you can copy/paste any of the available folders that are not “common” and use that as the base for your own project. As an example, let's make one for “human”. So, for example, copy “pig” (the KnetMiner Pig instance) to “human”:

    cp -r pig human

Customizing “client”
--------------------------

There are two important files that have to be changed per project in the "client” folder: <b>config.xml</b> and <b>utils-config.js</b>

* In client/src/main/webapp/html/javascript/<b>utils-config.js</b>:

    var data_url = "http://qtlnetminer-test.rothamsted.ac.uk/arabidopsis_data/";

has to be replaced by a valid path in which KnetMiner stores temporary results, for example, “http://localhost:8080/test_data” (for Tomcat)

    var data_url = "http://localhost:8080/test_data";

Make sure that this folder actually exists where your ROOT directory is and has the right owner (“tomcat:tomcat” by default).

Also change the other variables in utils-config.js to something reasonable for display purposes. For example, to adjust scaling in the GViewer in case the first chromosome is not the longest, add the following line of code:

    // specify value of the longest chromosome
    var longest_chr= 196087864;

* In client/src/main/resources/<b>config.xml</b>:

    <entry key="ServerHost">qtlnetminer-test</entry>
    <entry key="ServerPort">8189</entry>

has to be replaced by a valid server host and port on which the KnetMiner server application runs (e.g. localhost)

    <entry key="ServerHost">localhost</entry>
    <entry key="ServerPort">8189</entry>

In client/src/main/webapp are also HTML and png files that have to be customized to fit to the new project.

Files that have to be changed:

    client/src/main/webapp/html/index.jsp
Change information about the given organism.

    client/src/main/webapp/html/release.html
Change details about the data used (url's). The stats about the network are added programmatically when the instance is deployed.

    client/src/main/webapp/html/image/organism.png
Replace by appropriate compressed .png picture for <b><i>organism image</i></b> or delete (but then make sure to also delete the image in <b><i>index.jsp</i></b>).

    client/src/main/webapp/html/KnetMaps/config/url_mappings.json
Replace by an appropriate <b><i>url_mappings.json<i></b> file, if your client requires different url's shown in KnetMaps Item Info panel for concept accessions, than those in the default .json file in common/client/.

    client/src/main/webapp/html/data/basemap.xml
This file needs chromosome <i>'number'</i>, start, end positions and colors</i> for all chromosomes.

    client/src/main/webapp/html/data/sampleQuery.xml
Add details for sample queries. These can be simple queries with just search terms or have defined QTL regions and/or gene lists with them.

    client/pom.xml
Replace the name of the organism and increase 'modelVersion', if needed.

    QTLNetMiner/pom.xml
The QTLNetMiner pom.xml file also needs to have the name of your project folder (as a “module”) in order for it to be built and packaged by Maven as a part of the main KnetMiner project.


Customizing “server”
--------------------------

The most important file to customize is server/src/main/resources/<b>config.xml</b>
The directory under 

    <entry key="DataPath"> 

has to point to the same directory the “client” talks to under “var data_url” (i.e., "http://localhost:8080/test_data" for Tomcat) but not from the point of view of the client (URL + path) but from the point of view of the server (complete path, i.e.,  “/var/www/qltserver/test_data”). **IMPORTANT**: the server needs to be allowed to write into that directory. So for example, if you're using a Tomcat server, the folder will be owned by user "tomcat" in group "tomcat". Consider adding the user running the KnetMiner server to the "tomcat" group.

Furthermore, the species taxonomy ID under

    <entry key="SpeciesTaxId">

If you want to serve the shared folder via Tomcat (this is the easiest for SSL certificates) add the following line to your /etc/tomcat/server.xml inside the `<Host name="localhost">...</Host>` block:

```
<Context docBase="/var/www/qtlserver" path="/qtlserver" />
```

If you want to serve the folder via Apache (it's a bit of a hassle to get Tomcat SSL certificates into Apache) you have to add the following to /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf :

```
Alias /qtlserver /var/www/qtlserver
<Directory /var/www/qtlserver>
  Options Indexes FollowSymLinks MultiViews
  Require all granted
</Directory>
```

has to be identical to the species TaxID in the Ondex graph.

The server port has to be identical to “client”'s server port. The test_data directory is located on the server outside Tomcat.

The following files have to be customized as well:

    server/src/main/resources/chromosomes.xml
Change to the number and names of chromosomes.

    server/pom.xml
Change species name.

    server/src/main/scripts/startup.sh

The given OXL file has to point to the OXL file generated above using Ondex. Also adjust just the java parameters based on your server: -Xmx6G means that Java can use a maximum of 6 GB of RAM. Also change the path to Java from “/usr/java/latest/bin/java” to where it is on your server (use “which java” or just “java” should be enough, too).
