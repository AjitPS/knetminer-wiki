# Outline structure
KnetMiner consists of several _common _components in the `common/` folder. They are:
* server-datasource-api : containing shared definitions and data structures for all parts of KnetMiner
* server-datasource-ondexlocal : an Ondex-specific in-memory implementation of server-datasource
* server-datasource : an abstract definition of how a KnetMiner data source should function
* server-base : the abstract base code used to build and deploy a KnetMiner server
* ws-example : an _example _implementation of a KnetMiner server/ web services
* client-base : the abstract base code used to build and deploy a KnetMiner client

# Data sources
The fundamental unit of KnetMiner is a `datasource`. These are implementations of the `KnetminerDataSource` abstract class from the API. Implementing classes must be in the package `rres.knetminer.datasource.provider` or any sub-package of it. 

The most basic data source can extend this class directly. Others may have common requirements, such as an Ondex _index_, which can be provided by implementing an intermediate class then extending that instead. An example of this intermediate approach is the `server-datasource-ondexlocal` package which provides `OndexLocalDataSource`. Intermediate classes do not have to be in the correct package as long as the final implementing class is.

**Note** that one data source implementation can in principle provide several data sources, specified in the constructor then checked in the name of the datasource passed to its methods at runtime. 

# Deploying data sources and servers
Each `datasource` is built into a maven package. These maven packages are then declared as dependencies in the server, i.e. in the ws-example pom.xml file. The server is then compiled into a WAR. The declared depdendent datasources are _auto-detected _at runtime when the server WAR is deployed into Tomcat. _Multiple server WARs_ can be installed into the _same _Tomcat as long as their datasource names do _not _conflict. 

# WS-example
This project is just an _example implementation_ of server-base. It should be renamed for production use and cloned as many times as necessary for each local instance required, e.g, in the species folders as in `wheat/ws`, etc.. The datasources it provides are configured in its `pom.xml` file.

# New server endpoints
The server is controlled via KnetminerServer in server-base. New endpoints can be added here by adjusting the _pattern recognition_ or adding _new methods_ with appropriate annotations. Incoming data is always `JSON`, the format of which is allowed for by `KnetminerRequest` in `server-datasource-api`. This one class contains all possible input parameters and suitable non-null defaults for each, regardless of which ones are used by which request. Responses are always `JSON` and defined by implementations of `KnetminerResponse` in `server-datasource-api`.
