## Introduction

Knetminer can be deployed in a quick and simple way, using the Docker container platform. In 
the simplest case, you just need to install the Docker environment and get our
[Knetminer image from DockerHub][10]. For more advanced uses, our image can be used with 
host-provided configurations. 
Additionally, you can [develop changes to Knetminer](#developing-knetminer-with-docker), starting from 
our [image definitions](#the-knetminer-docker-architecture).

## Running Knetminer via Docker

### Quick start with the sample dataset

You can quickly run an instance of Knetminer, based on a small sample data set (a subset of the 
[Arabidopsis Thaliana][15], named Aratiny (see next sections). To do so, just install Docker and issue 
this line commad:

`docker run -p 8080:8080 -it knetminer/knetminer`

This will get our Knetminer image straight from Docker Hub. You'll see output on your 
shell window and eventually you'll be able to access the sample application via 
http://localhost:8080/client (as usually, you can change the port on the host via `-p`).  

Running without further parameters makes our container to use the configuration and data it 
has in its file system (which, as said, is the Arabidopsis subset). 

*Note: the `-it` options are needed because of the way the startup command associated to our container works, as explained [here](https://stackoverflow.com/a/41099052/529286).*

[15]: https://knetminer.rothamsted.ac.uk/Arabidopsis_thaliana/

**WARNING: until this note is removed, you might need to [rebuild the Docker image(s) locally]
(#building-docker-images), before issuing `docker run` commands, since DockerHub images might be not 
up-to-date.**

### Doing it simpler: the `docker-run.sh` script

The [docker-run.sh script][20] is provided to make the invocation of the Knetminer container as simple 
as possible, essentially by building Knetminer-specific `docker run` commands. For instance, the 
equivalent of the command that we just showed, assuming Docker is running, is simply:

`./docker-run.sh` 

A variant of it, which maps the container to the port 8090, is:

`./docker-run.sh --host-port 8090`

In the follow, we describe more complex cases and show how to realise them via the `docker-run.sh` 
script.  

Note that you don't need to download (ie, `git clone`) the whole Knetminer codebase to get this script, 
you just need to [download a raw copy][30] of it and then it will use our DockerHub image (see the warning above).

### Instantiating a specific the dataset

While the example above runs Knetminer against a default dataset, a different application instance can be 
run against a dataset of choice. In order to do so, we need to introduce the concepts of dataset and 
dataset directory.  

A **dataset** is a set of data that serves a Knetminer instance. Most of datasets we provide are focused on a single specie, so we have datasets named arabidopsis, wheat, rice, etc. Also, sometimes we use the word specie as synonim of dataset.  

A **dataset directory** contains all dataset-specific information that a Knetminer instance needs to run a dataset. Except for the default case (based on Aratiny and its data already stored in the Docker image),
**You must provide a dataset directory** to run Knetminer against a new instance. The typical way to do 
so is to create such a directory in your Docker host (ie, the one that runs the container). The most 
important folders in the dataset directory are:

  * `<dataset-dir>/settings/` contains the **dataset settings**, a set of files that are used to generate 
  a final configuration (stored in `<dataset-dir>/config` for the Knetminer instance. When creating a 
  dataset directory, the `settings/` directory can be omitted and taken from our pre-packaged definitions,
   which we provide in the [GitHub specie/ directory][40]. We explain details below.

  * `<dataset-dir>/data/`, this is where Knetminer finds and stores all the data it uses to run an 
  instance. Initially, you **must** provide the file `<dataset-dir>/data/knowledge-network.oxl`, 
  containing the dataset core data in the [Ondex][50] format. For pre-defined settings, we usually 
  provide such file upon request.

So, suppose you want to run the wheat dataset, using our pre-defined settings. The steps to follow are:

  1. Create the dataset directory on the Docker host, eg, `mkdir /home/knetminer/wheat-dataset`
  2. Create the data directory, `mkdir /home/knetminer/wheat-dataset/data`, and copy our wheat OXL under
  `/home/knetminer/wheat-dataset/data/knowledge-network.oxl`
  3. Run with the wheat predefined dataset id (`--dataset-id` option):

```bash
./docker-run.sh \
  --dataset-id wheat \
  --dataset-dir /home/knetminer/wheat-dataset \
  --host-port 8090 \
  --container-name 'docker-wheat' \
  --container-memory 20G
  --detach
```

This command will create `/home/knetminer/wheat-dataset/settings`, which will contain a copy of the 
settings coming from our GitHub. The other options given to the command maps the "Knetminer Wheat" 
instance to the host port 8090, names the corresponding container `docker-wheat` (a useful reference for 
all Docker commands), grants it 20G of memory and detaches it (ie, the script immediately ends with the 
container remaining in background). See `docker-run.sh --help` for a documented list of all available 
options.

The bare Docker equivalent of the command above is:

```bash
docker run -it --detach -p 8090:8080 --name docker-wheat --memory 20G \
       --volume /home/knetminer/wheat-dataset:/root/knetminer-dataset \
       knetminer/knetminer:latest wheat
```

As you can see, the way your dataset directory on the Docker host is seen by the container is by mapping 
it to a container's path, via Docker volume mapping.

After the command above, the corresponding Docker instance should be available at 
`http://localhost:8090/client`. The startup phase of large datasets takes long time, so you might need 
some time (30 mins to few hours) before this URL will start showing something on your browser. The 
container can be stopped via `Control-C`.

### Cleaning the working files

The Knetminer WS application creates a number of working files in the configured dataset directory. We 
recommend to clean them before restarting a container. The [cleanup-volume.sh][65] script is provided for 
this and it's use is pretty simple:

`./cleanup-volume.sh /root/knetminer-test/knetminer-datasets/arabidopsis`

The command will leave directories like `settings/` or files like `data/knowledge-network.oxl` untouched.

### Enabling Neo4j

TODO


## Creating new settings for a new dataset

If you want to create a new dataset (eg, for a new specie), rather than using one of the predefined ones, 
typically you'll want to define your own settings, instead of using the `--dataset-id`. You have to do so
by creating certain files under `<dataset-dir>/settings/`. The quickest way to create such a directory is 
to make a copy from our [species/][40] directory and modify it.  

In this section, we go through the details. To summarise the details given below, for each 
dataset/specie, you have to take care of the following files:

  * `<dataset-dir>/settings/maven-settings.xml`, defining a number of configuration values, which are passed to Maven
  to populate other files mentioned below
  * `<dataset-dir>/settings/client/*`, defining specie-specific web files for the client application
  * `<dataset-dir>/settings/ws/SemanticMotifs.txt`, defining graph patterns that relate genes to other entities of interest.
  * `<dataset-dir>/settings/ws/neo4j/` to be used in Neo4j mode (TODO: details).


### Maven settings

These are mostly defined by `<dataset-dir>/settings/maven-settings.xml` The values in this file are used 
to  instantiate Maven build variables throughout the [aratiny][70] project, which is a 
test/demo/reference implementation of a Knetminer application (see below).

The variables in the specie-specific Maven settings override defaults defined in the 
[Knetminer's main POM][80] (both in the `<properties>` and `<profiles>` sections).


[70]: https://github.com/Rothamsted/knetminer/tree/master/common/aratiny
[80]: https://github.com/Rothamsted/knetminer/tree/master/pom.xml


### Client settings

These are located in `<dataset-dir>/settings/client` and contains:
  * dataset-specific web files for the client WAR (ie, the user interface application), eg, 
  `organism.png`, `background.png`, `release_notes.html`
  * dataset-specific configuration files put into the client WAR. At the moment the only 
  file of this type is `sampleQuery.xml`, which defines sample queries appearing on the right 
  column of the Knetminer interface.

Client files are used by the Docker container **at runtime**, after the corresponding image 
has been built. In fact, the Docker container uses the files in `<dataset-dir>/settings/client` to 
override the reference client application and then rebuild the corresponding WAR, before passing it to 
the Tomcat server and launching it. Rebuilding the client is necessary, since there isn't another 
practical way to push specific static files or variants or Javascript files (which are based on Maven 
settings, see next sections). 


### Server settings

The main server setting files, located in `<dataset-dir>/settings/ws/` are: 
  * `SemanticMotifs.txt`, which defines graph patterns that relate genes to 
  other entities of interest. This is used for [ranking gene searches][90] based on gene evidence.
  * `neo4j/`, which contains configuration related to Knetminer running in Neo4j mode 
  (TODO: additions due).

Note that, differently than the client, the server WAR is generated once for all **at image 
build time**, not at runtime. That's because the WAR is independent on any specific dataset 
you want run Knetminer with. However, the runtime still uses Maven to instantiate (in Maven 
terms, interpolate) client and server configuration files with specie/dataset specific 
values. It does so by issuing maven `test-compile` against `aratiny-ws`.

[90]: https://pub.uni-bielefeld.de/publication/2915227


### Generated files

Knetminer uses the files in the `settings/` directory (in addition to defaults in the Maven POMs) to 
generate actual configuration files, into `<dataset-dir>/config`. Usually you don't need to change these 
files, we list some of them hereby, since they might be useful for Knetminer development and customisation

**Note**: for the time being, changes to the files below **must** be put into the Knetminer codebase. You 
**cannot** place them into `<dataset-dir>/config`, since the copies in this directory are always 
re-generated from the settings. TODO: in future, we will add a `--keep-config` option, for testing 
purposes.

The main of these files is [data-source.xml][100], which is the first config item the WS application 
looks for during its bootstrap stage. In turn, this file points to other paths, like 
`${knetminer.dataDir}`, the location where application-generated data are stored (eg, Lucene Indexes), or 
`${knetminer.oxlFile}`, the location where the dataset's OXL file is. The defaults for these values are such that they fall under `<dataset-dir>/data`.

Note also that these two locations aren't dataset-specific in the Docker container: the data dir is always `/root/knetminer-dataset/data` and the OXL file is always
`/root/knetminer-dataset/data/knowledge-network.oxl`. That's because, as mentioned above, the final 
locations for these directories and files are established by means of volume-based 
mapping. That's why you don't find the corresponding variables in 
`<dataset-dir>/settings/maven-settings.xml`. Rather, they're defined in the [main POM][80], (the 
`docker` Maven profile defines the Docker-specific values, while defaults on the top of the POMs are used for building a Jetty-based test environment during Maven builds).

Finally, the `<dataset-dir>` directory contains a `client-src/` directory, where the source files for the 
client (ie, user interface) are generated, using a combination of default files (coming from Aratiny, see next sections) and files coming from `settings/client/`, after that these are populated with values from `maven-settings.xml` and other Maven default properties.

## Using Dockerised Knetminer with Amazon AWS and ElasticBeanStalk

TODO: we need to test the new image on AWS and write documentation.


## The Knetminer Docker architecture

### What's behind the scenes

Knetminer, and consequently its Docker image, is based on two WAR applications: the web service (WS), 
which provides an HTTP/JSON based API, and the client, which is the user interface, based on a couple of 
technologies like JSP, Javascript, NPM packages.  

Both the WS and the client WAR are built from the [Aratiny][70] project. This is a Knetminer reference/
test application, which is usually run against a small default dataset. In turn, aratiny has dependencies 
from other more generic Maven modules and files (eg, `client-base`, `ws-base`).  

As already mentioned, in Docker, the WS WAR is made once for all during the image build, while the client 
WAR is rebuilt at runtime, after its source files are rebuilt by overriding the aratiny client files with 
files coming from the settings, as explained above (aratiny is built and tested during the Knetminer 
default build, without any overriding, see the GitHub sources for details).  

The Docker container gets/writes dataset-specific files from/to a fixed location inside its file system, 
which is `/root/knetminer-dataset/`. As explained above, this maps to customised versions on the Docker 
host by means of Docker volumes.  

### One picture...

The figure below (`Right click => Open Image` to view the original size) summarises how the Knetminer 
Docker container works, as explained above, which directories are used, either on the container file system or on the host, plus the mappings between each other.  

As said above, the Docker image contains a copy of the Knetminer codebase, which is initially used to build the WS WAR and later, to build a dataset-specific instance of the client WAR. In both cases, the Aratiny reference application is used.  Namely, `mvn test-compile` is issued at runtime against the dataset-specifc variants of the aratinty WAR projects.  

![Docker Architecture Diagram](docker-arch.png)


### Docker images

For practical reasons, we use different Docker images to instantiate the final Knetminer container.  

As usually, the main container is defined by the [Dockerfile image file][110]. This builds 
what is needed to deploy our web applications (two .war files) on our Java web server 
(Tomcat).  

This application image extends the [Dockerfile-base image][120]. This prepares a container 
with all the Maven-reachable dependencies downloaded and placed into the container file 
system.  

Finally, the base image depends on [Dockerfile-bare image][130]. This pulls up the 
[Andre's Tomcat container][140], which is essentially a Debian Linux with Java and Tomcat installed, 
and additionally deploys third-party dependencies that are needed by Knetminer (eg, Maven, 
the Node.js package manager, NPM).  

The motivation for distributing the build of the final container into three different images 
is that this makes the development quicker. For instance, if one needs just to change a web 
application page, pushing such changes forwar requires only the rebuild of the main container.

## Developing Knetminer with Docker

### Building Docker images

This works with the usual `docker build` command, but **you need to issue it from the root of our 
codebase** (the one created by `git clone`). That's because the build process copies the codebase into 
the container and there isn's a way in Docker to copy from directories located above the one the build 
command is started from. So, to build from scratch (and from the master branch in our repository) you need:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Rothamsted/knetminer # Or another fork/branch
cd knetminer
# You don't always need to rebuild all of them, see below
# ==> After the first time, you might need --no-cache to force the rebuild
docker build -t knetminer/knetminer-bare -f common/quickstart/Dockerfile-bare . 
docker build -t knetminer/knetminer-base -f common/quickstart/Dockerfile-base . 
docker build -t knetminer/knetminer -f common/quickstart/Dockerfile . 
```

### So, what do I need to rebuild each time?

This depends on what you're doing:

  * If you changed the codebase, without adding third-party Maven dependencies, probably you only need to 
  rebuild the main image. However, sometimes this doesn't work (eg, an existing third-party dependency 
  was re-uploaded on an external Maven artifactory) and you need to rebuild the bare image too.
  * If you changed third-party dependencies, rebuild the base image and then the main image.
  * You rarely need to rebuild the base image, essentially only if you want to change general settings for the container environment (eg, Linux or JDK version)

When you don't rebuild an image and this isn't in your Docker cache already, it is taken from [our DockerHub][145]

**WARNING: we're still unable to auto-update images as we update our code in GitHub. So, it's likely the 
two won't be always aligned for the time being. Until we remove this warning, try to rebuild the images(s)
on your side if you see problems.**

[145]: https://cloud.docker.com/u/knetminer/repository/docker/knetminer/knetminer


### Building with different image tags/versions

You can interact with Docker the tagging (versioning) mechanism to build different versions of Knetminer 
images. For instance, the following, builds images with a 'test' version (instead of 'latest', 
which is the implied tag when nothing is specified):

```bash
# Build the base image and assign it to the 'test' tag/version
docker build -t knetminer/knetminer-base:test -f common/quickstart/Dockerfile-base . 
# Does the same for the main image and also uses the 'test' variant as a dependency (via --build-arg)
docker build -t knetminer/knetminer:review --build-arg DOCKER_TAG=review -f common/quickstart/Dockerfile .
```

**Note to Knetminer developers**: this is the way to push images to DockerHub, ie, push it after having 
built a given version (and using the same image coordinates). It can be useful to publish images that 
correspond to a given branch or fork.


### Build and test Knetminer out of Docker

As long as you install the necessary requirements ([Linux][148], [Windows][150]), Knetminer can be built 
under your working computer, without involving Docker at all.  

A simple way to do so is to build and play with the already-mentioned [Aratiny application][70]. This is 
mainly useful to develop new application features (which apply to any dataset), test them and even adding 
unit tests that verify them (`aratiny-ws` already [contains a few of them][152]). Changes to thhis 
existing application can happen directly into its Maven modules, or on its dependencies (eg, 
`client-base`), depending on the type of change you're introducing.

**WARNING**: always consider that this is a **reference** application, anything you change here is 
reflected on the dataset-specific instances that Docker builds based on Aratiny.

Another useful thing is the [manual-test scripts][154] within the Aratiny application, which can be used 
to quickly launch a working server running the Aratiny applications and accessible from your browser. See 
the files on GitHub for details.

A third option is to build and run the WAR files in your system, using the same scripts that are used to 
build the Docker image, and to run the corresponding container. These are [`build-helper.sh`][156] and 
[`runtime-helper.sh`][158]. Indeed, these scripts are designed to work both with Docker and out of it. 
See their content for comments on how to use them. Moreover, have a look at [this example in the codebase][157].  

**Warning**: if you are a Knetminer developer putting your hands on those scripts, always **ensure** the 
above portability isn't broken.

## Troubleshooting

In this section, we show a few details that can be useful to debug and troubleshoot the Docker container 
for Knetminer.

### Access to logs

There are two log outputs from the container that you might want to check. One is the standard output from Tomcat, which can be accessed from the host via a command like:

`docker logs -f arabidopsis`

where `arabidopsis` is the name you assigned to the container upon run.

The other interesting logs are in the Tomcat home. In particular, you might want to give a look to the 
Knetminer WS log. This host command will show it live, until you stop with `Control-C`

`docker exec -it arabidopsis tail -f /usr/local/tomcat/logs/ws.log`

Another thing that might be useful is mapping the Tomcat logs directory to some location on the host, eg:

```bash
export DOCKER_OPTS='-it --volume /home/knetminer-logs:/usr/local/tomcat/logs'
./docker-run.sh ...
```

In particular, this is what you might need to ease the access to tools like web log analysers.


### Access to the Tomcat manager

The Docker build command for the Knetminer image can be invoked with one parameter, a password for the 
[Tomcat Manager web application][110], which can be useful to know if our WARs were started, as well as 
operations like quick deployment of a new WAR under a running Tomcat/container.

This can be done with a command like:

`docker build -t knetminer/knetminer -f common/quickstart/Dockerfile --build-arg TOMCAT_PASSWORD='foo123' .`

**Remember** to **NOT** use easy passwords for production images! These are accessible via web. Ideally, 
don't enable the manager in production.


### Partial builds

During the developement stage, when you have frequently to change a little bit about the Knetminer code 
and rebuild the corresponding image, you might want to build only certain Maven modules, rather than the 
whole Knetminer. 

You can do this the following way:

  1. Ensure the last versions or the Maven modules you're not rebuilding are correctly deployed on our
  Maven artifactory server.
  1. Edit the [build helper][156], as specified by the following lines, that you find in the script:
  ```bash
  # ---- Regular full build of the server web reference application (aratiny-ws.war) ----
  mvn clean install $MAVEN_ARGS -DskipTests -DskipITs
  cd common/aratiny/aratiny-ws
  # --- Alternatively, you can enable fast build during debugging
  # mvn dependency:resolve
  # cd common/aratiny/aratiny-ws
  # mvn clean install $MAVEN_ARGS -DskipTests -DskipITs
  # ---
  ```
  3. Run the `docker build` command as explained above. This should rebuild things quickly, depending on 
  the subset of modules you select for the Maven build.

  **Remember to not push the above changes back to GitHub**.
