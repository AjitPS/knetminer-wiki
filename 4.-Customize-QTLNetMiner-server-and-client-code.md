Customizing both server and client
------------------------------------------

Now, you can copy/paste any of the available folders that are not “common” and use that as the base for your own project. As an example, let's make one for “human”. So, for example, copy “pig” (the QTLNetMiner Pig instance) to “human”:

    cp -r pig human

Customizing “client”
--------------------------

There are two important files that have to be changed per project in the "client” folder: <b>config.xml</b> and <b>utils-config.js</b>

* In client/src/main/webapp/html/javascript/<b>utils-config.js</b>:

    var data_url = "http://qtlnetminer-test.rothamsted.ac.uk/arabidopsis_data/";

has to be replaced by a valid path in which QTLNetMiner stores temporary results, for example, “http://localhost:8080/test_data” (for Tomcat)

    var data_url = "http://localhost:8080/test_data";

Make sure that this folder actually exists where your ROOT directory is and has the right owner (“tomcat:tomcat” by default).

Also change the other variables in utils-config.js to something reasonable for display purposes. For example, to adjust scaling in the GViewer in case the first chromosome is not the longest, add the following line of code:
    var longest_chr= 196087864; // specify value of the longest chromosome

* In client/src/main/resources/<b>config.xml</b>:

    <entry key="ServerHost">qtlnetminer-test</entry>
    <entry key="ServerPort">8189</entry>

has to be replaced by a valid server host and port on which the QTLNetMiner server application runs (e.g. localhost)

    <entry key="ServerHost">localhost</entry>
    <entry key="ServerPort">8189</entry>

In client/src/main/webapp are also HTML and jpg files that have to be customized to fit to the new project.

Files that have to be changed:
    client/src/main/webapp/html/index.jsp
Change information about the given organism.

    client/src/main/webapp/html/release.html
Change details about the data used.

    client/src/main/webapp/html/image/organism.png
Replace by appropriate picture or delete (but then make sure to also delete the image in <b><i>index.jsp</i></b>).

    client/src/main/webapp/html/data/basemap.xml
This file needs start, end positions and colors for all chromosomes.

    client/src/main/webapp/html/data/sampleQuery.xml
Add details for sample queries.

    client/pom.xml
Replace the name of the organism and increase 'modelVersion', if needed.

    QTLNetMiner/pom.xml
The QTLNetMiner pom.xml file also needs to have the name of your project folder (as a “module”) in order for it to be built and packaged by Maven as a part of the main QTLNetMiner project.


Customizing “server”
--------------------------

The most important file to customize is server/src/main/resources/<b>config.xml</b>
The directory under 

    <entry key="DataPath"> 

has to point to the same directory the “client” talks to under “var data_url” (i.e., "http://localhost:8080/test_data" for Tomcat) but not from the point of view of the client (URL + path) but from the point of view of the server (complete path, i.e.,  “/var/www/qtltserver/test_data”). **IMPORTANT**: the server needs to be allowed to write into that directory. So for example, if you're using a Tomcat server, the folder will be owned by user "tomcat" in group "tomcat". Consider adding the user running the QTLNetMiner server to the "tomcat" group.

Furthermore, the species taxonomy ID under

    <entry key="SpeciesTaxId">

has to be identical to the species TaxID in the Ondex graph.

The server port has to be identical to “client”'s server port. The test_data directory is located on the server outside Tomcat.

The following files have to be customized as well:

    server/src/main/resources/<b>chromosomes.xml</b>
Change to the number and names of chromosomes.

    server/src/main/scripts/<b>startup.sh</b>:
The given OXL file has to point to the OXL file generated above using Ondex. Also adjust just the java parameters based on your server: -Xmx6G means that Java can use a maximum of 6 GB of RAM. Also change the path to Java from “/usr/java/latest/bin/java” to where it is on your server (use “which java” or just “java” should be enough, too).
