Customizing both server and client
------------------------------------------

Now, you can copy/paste any of the available folders that are not “common” and use that as the base for your own project. As an example, let's make one for “human”. So copy “pig” to “human”:

    cp -r pig human

Customizing “client”
--------------------------

There are two important files that have to be changed per project in the folder “client”: config.xml and utils-config.js

client/src/main/webapp/html/javascript/utils-config.js

    var data_url = "http://qtlnetminer-test.rothamsted.ac.uk/arabidopsis_data/";

has to be replaced by a valid path in which QTLNetMiner stores temporary results, for example, “http://localhost:8080/test_data” (for Tomcat)

    var data_url = "http://localhost:8080/test_data";

Make sure that this folder actually exists where your ROOT directory is and has the right owner (“tomcat:tomcat” by default).

Also change the other variables in that file to something reasonable for display purposes.

client/src/main/resources/config.xml

    <entry key="ServerHost">qtlnetminer-test</entry>

has to be replaced by a valid URL on which Tomcat runs, for example, localhost:8080 

    <entry key="ServerHost">localhost:8080</entry>

In client/src/main/webapp are also HTML and jpg files that have to be customised to fit to the new project.

Files that have to be changed:

    client/src/main/webapp/html/index.jsp

Change information about the given organism.

    client/src/main/webapp/html/release.html

Change details about the data used.

    client/src/main/webapp/html/image/organism.png

Replace by appropriate picture or delete (but then make sure to also delete the image in index.jsp).

    client/src/main/webapp/html/data/basemap.xml

This file needs start, end positions and colors for all chromosomes.

    client/src/main/webapp/html/data/geneposition.txt

This file needs start, end and chromosome for all known genes.

    client/src/main/webapp/html/data/sampleQuery.xml

Add details for sample queries.

    client/pom.xml

Replace the name of the organism and increase modelVersion if needed.

    QTLNetMiner/pom.xml

The QTLNetMiner pom.xml file also needs to have the name of your project folder (as a “module”) in order for it to be built and packaged as a part of the main QTLNetMiner project.


Customising “server”
--------------------------

The most important file to customise is server/src/main/resources/config.xml
The directory under 

    <entry key="DataPath"> 

has to point to the same directory the “client” talks to under “var data_url” (i.e., "http://localhost:8080/test_data" for Tomcat) but not from the point of view of the client (URL + path) but from the point of view of the server (complete path, i.e.,  “/var/www/qtltserver/test_data”). **IMPORTANT**: the server needs to be allowed to write into that directory. So for example, if you're using a Tomcat server, the folder will be owned by user "tomcat" in group "tomcat". Consider adding the user running the QTLNetMiner server to the "tomcat" group.

Furthermore, the species taxonomy ID under

    <entry key="SpeciesTaxId">

has to be identical to the species TaxID in the Ondex graph.

The server port has to be identical to “client”'s server port. The test_data directory is located on the server outside Tomcat.

The following files have to be customized as well:

    server/src/main/resources/chromosomes.xml

Change to the number and names of chromosomes.

    server/src/main/scripts/startup.sh:

The given OXL file has to point to the OXL file generated above using Ondex. Also adjust just the java parameters based on your server: -Xmx6G means that Java can use a maximum of 6 GB of RAM. Also change the path to Java from “/usr/java/latest/bin/java” to where it is on your server (use “which java” or just “java” should be enough, too).
